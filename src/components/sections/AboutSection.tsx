        <p>
          I'm a passionate engineering student with a deep love for technology and innovation. 
          My journey in tech began with curiosity about how things work, and has evolved into 
          a mission to create solutions that make a real difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          I specialize in frontend development, creating beautiful and functional user experiences 
          using modern technologies like React and Next.js. But my interests don't stop there â€“ 
          I'm also diving deep into machine learning and AI, exploring how these technologies 
          can be integrated into web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you'll find me participating in hackathons, contributing to open-source 
          projects, or learning about the latest tech trends. I believe in the power of collaboration 
          and continuous learning to drive innovation forward.
